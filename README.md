# EECS
EECS (Embedded Emergency Correspondence System) is an Arduino Project our team built during Avenue E 2022 transfer bridge at UC Davis.

Our team members are Alyssalyn Ursal, Jacob Feenstra, Jose Gavidia Paz, and Peiqi Zhu.

The Prototype1.0 folder includes codes, a demonstration video, and a poster we created during the transfer bridge program.
