# EECS
EECS (Emergency Correspondence System) is an Arduino Project our team built during Avenue E transfer bridge at UC Davis.
Our team members are Alyssalyn Ursal, Jacob Feenstra, Jose Gavidia Paz, and Peiqi Zhu.
The Prototype1.0 folder includes codes, a demonstration video, and a poster we created during the transfer bridge program.
